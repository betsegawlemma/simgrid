/** @addtogroup GRAS_timer
 *  @brief Delayed and repetitive tasks (Communication facility)
 *
 *  This is how to have a specific function called only once after the
 *  specified amount of time or a function executed every 5 mn until it gets 
 *  removed. In the UNIX world, this is comparable to <tt>at</tt> and 
 *  <tt>cron</tt>.
 *
 *  Note that this is very soft timers: the execution of the processes won't
 *  get interrupted at all. This is on purpose: the GRAS programming model
 *  is distributed sequential, so that users don't have to deal with mutexes
 *  and such within a specific process.
 *
 *  Timers are served by the gras_handle() function: if there is an elapsed 
 *  timer, the associated code gets executed before any incomming connexion 
 *  are checked. 
 *
 *  The section \ref GRAS_ex_timer constitutes a perfect example of these features.
 *
