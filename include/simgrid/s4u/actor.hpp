 * 
 * An actor is an independent stream of execution in your distributed application.
 *
 * You can think of an actor as a process in your distributed application, or as a thread in a multithreaded program.
 * This is the only component in SimGrid that actually does something on its own, executing its own code. 
 * A resource will not get used if you don't schedule activities on them. This is the code of Actors that create and schedule these activities.
 * 
 * An actor is located on a (simulated) host, but it can interact
 * with the whole simulated platform.
 * 
 * (back to the @ref s4u_api "S4U documentation")
 * 
 * @section s4u_actor_def Defining an Actor
 * 
 * The code of an actor (ie, the code that this actor will run when starting) the () operator.
 * In this code, your actor can use the functions of the simgrid::s4u::this_actor namespace to interact with the world.
 * 
 * For example, a Worker actor should be declared as follows:
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 * #include "s4u/actor.hpp"
 * 
 * class Worker {
 *   void operator()() { // Two pairs of () because this defines the method called ()
 *     printf("Hello s4u");
 *     simgrid::s4u::this_actor::execute(5*1024*1024); // Get the worker executing a task of 5 MFlops
 *   }
 * };
 * \endcode
 * 
 * @section s4u_actor_new Creating a new instance of your Actor
 * 
 * // Then later in your main() function or so:
 *   ...
 *   new Actor("worker", host, Worker());
 *   ...
 *
 * You can start your actors with simple @c new, for example from the @c main function, 
 * but this is usually considered as a bad habit as it makes it harder to test your application
 * in differing settings. Instead, you are advised to use an XML deployment file using 
 * s4u::Engine::loadDeployment() to start your actors.
 *
