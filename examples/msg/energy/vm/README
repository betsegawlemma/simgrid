Fact 1: 
Two hosts: one task on the PM, the two hosts have the same energyfootprint
Fact 2: 
Two hosts: host1 hosts one VM, one task inside the VM (the same task as before), another task on the PM. the VM is correctly shutdowned at the end. Energy seems to consider the two tasks (that is the energyfootprint is equals to the energyfootprint to one host with two tasks.

Issue 1: 
If you kill the VM before terminating internal tasks you get warning and energy is not correct
