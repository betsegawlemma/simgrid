S4U (Simgrid for you) is the next interface of SimGrid, expected to be released with SimGrid 4.0.

Even if it's in a very preliminary state so far, you are welcome to
try it and report any interface glitches that you see. Be however
warned that the interface will be modified until its final release. 
You will have to adapt your code on the way.

This file follows the Doxygen syntax to be included in the
documentation, but it should remain readable directly.

@section s4u_ex_basics Basics of SimGrid simulation

  - <b>Launching actors:</b> @ref examples/s4u/launching/s4u_launching.cpp and 
    @ref examples/s4u/launching/deployment.xml \n
    Shows how to start your actors to populate your simulation.

  - <b>Token ring:</b> @ref examples/s4u/app-token-ring/s4u_app-token-ring.cpp \n
    Shows how to implement a classical communication pattern, where a token is exchanged along a ring to reach every
    participant.

  - <b>Master Workers:</b> @ref examples/s4u/app-token-ring/s4u_app-token-ring.cpp \n
    Another good old example, where one Master process has a bunch of task to dispatch to a set of several Worker 
    processes. 

@section s4u_ex_synchro Inter-Actor Synchronization 

 - <b>Mutex: </b> @ref examples/s4u/mutex/s4u_mutex.cpp \n
   Shows how to use simgrid::s4u::Mutex synchronization objects.
