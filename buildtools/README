The CMake configuration in this directory cannot be used to build SimGrid
Instead, it can be used to auto-test it.

To use it, you need a svn checkout under ~/simgrid-svn. Command to create it:
   cd 
   svn checkout svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/simgrid/simgrid/trunk simgrid-svn

Then, you need to create a distribution archive, with this command:
   ~/simgrid-svn/buildtools/scripts/make_dist.sh
The archive will be copied into the ~/simgrid directory.


Then, you can test the archive with autotools only using that command:
   ~/simgrid-svn/buildtools/scripts/test_dist_with_autotools.sh   
Alternatively, you can test the archive with cmake using that command:
   ~/simgrid-svn/buildtools/scripts/test_dist_with_cmake.sh

Please note that autotools are needed in any cases. Only the test
mechanism changes between the two pathes so far.
