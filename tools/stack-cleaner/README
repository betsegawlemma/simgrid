Provides stack-cleaning compilers for x86_64:

 * as
 * cc
 * c++

Each of them modify the generated/given X86_64 assembly by prepending
stack-cleanup code to each function:

	movq $QSIZE, %r11
.Lloop:
        movq $0, OFFSET(%rsp,%r11,8)
        subq $1, %r11
        jne  .Lloop

The modification of the assembly is done by the clean-stack-filter
program.

If the underlying compiler is clang, it might be necessary to add the
-no-integrated-as flag in order to force the usage of an external
assembler.
