@page GRAS_tut_tour_install Lesson 0: Installing GRAS

Since GRAS is technically part of the SimGrid project, you have to install
SimGrid to install GRAS. Doing so is explained in the relevant FAQ section
(\ref install). 

Newcommers should install the stable release from the tarball, since the 
snapshots may suffer from (additionnal;) stability issues. Only go for the
git if you really need features not present in the stable releases yet (or
if you plan to help us improving the tool, what is always welcomed).

Proceed to \ref GRAS_tut_tour_setup.
