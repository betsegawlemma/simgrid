    \section GRAS_funct Offered functionnalities
     - <b>Communication facilities</b>: Exchanging messages between peers
       - \ref GRAS_dd: any data which may transit on the network must be
         described beforehand so that GRAS can handle the platform
         heterogeneity and convert them if needed.
       - \ref GRAS_sock: this is how to open a communication channel to
         other processes, and retrive information about them.
       - \ref GRAS_msg: communications are message oriented. You have to
         describe all possible messages and their payload beforehand, and
         can then attach callbacks to the arrival of a given kind of message. 
     - <b>Virtualization</b>: Running both on top of the simulator and on
       top of real platforms, and portability support.
       - \ref GRAS_globals: The use of globals is forbidden since the
         "processes" are threads in simulation mode. \n
	 This is how to let GRAS handle your globals properly.
       - \ref GRAS_cond: How to declare specific code for the simulation mode
          or for the real mode.
       - \ref GRAS_virtu: You naturally don't want to call the
          gettimeofday(2) function in simulation mode since it would give
          you the time on the host running the simulation, not the time in
          the simulated world (you are belonging to).\n
	  This a system call virtualization layer, which also acts as a
          portability layer.
	  
    \section GRAS_example Examples
      
    There is for now rather few examples of GRAS, but it's better than
    nothing, isn't it?

    \section GRAS_todo TODO
     Documentation related:
       - Add an example to the \ref GRAS_msg section, at least
       - Document examples/gras/gras_stub_generator utility and how to deal
         with the fact that programs must have a main in RL and not in SG.
       - Document example/gras/ping as it uses almost all of the GRAS
         features.
     
     Code related: too long to be written here. See the TODO file
