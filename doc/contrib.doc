\section contrib_intro A contrib section ? Why ?

Many people have come to ask us more complex examples than the simple ones
that are distributed with the main branch of the SimGrid project. We do not
want to include complex examples in the main branch but we think it is a
good idea that users share their experience. That is why we have created a
contrib branch that can be used by people who have a nice piece of work
using SimGrid and accept to share it. The licence of this code should be
LGPL if possible. If you can't licence your code with LGPL, just tell us
about it and we will try to sort out whether it makes sense to publish it
here.

\subsection contrib_msg_gridmatrix Grid Matrix

<a href="http://research.nektra.com/Grid_Matrix">Grid Matrix</a> is an
application that lets you create your grid network and simulate the
execution of distributed applications from a Graphic User Interface
(GUI).

  - Features:
    - Complete design of the network.
    - Bindings for MSG.
    - Simulation run within the GUI.
    - Pause / Stop simulation.
    - Multiple trace options.
    - Python output and errors redirected to the GUI.
    - Grid Nodes change their red intensity to show activity.
    - Custom activity can be set by Python scripts.
    - Create graphics from scripts.
  - Requirements:
    - Microsoft Visual Studio VS2005 SP1 runtime
  - Future works:
    - Support other APIs in SimGrid.
    - Add a form to set process parameters.
    - Linux support.

\subsection contrib_msg_simboinc SimBoinc

SimBOINC is a simulator for heterogeneous and volatile desktop grids
and volunteer computing systems. The goal of this project is to
provide a simulator by which to test new scheduling strategies in
BOINC, and other desktop and volunteer systems, in general.

It is contributed by Derrick Kondo and can be found here:

\subsection contrib_msg_garsim GarSim

GarSim is a simulator of a scheduling meta-system or just of a batch
system. This code is written in C++ and has many dependencies (with
python, sqlite, some parts of condor, ...). 

It is maintained by Vincent Garonne (garonne::lal.in2p3.fr), and is
part of the SimGrid SVN (directory contrib/garSim).

\subsection contrib_msg_simbatch Simbatch

This program simulates the behavior of a batch scheduler managing a
cluster. 

This program is maintained by Jean-Sebastien Gay
(Jean-Sebastien.Gay at ens-lyon.fr), and is part of the SimGrid SVN
(directory contrib/Simbatch).


\section contrib_gras Projects relying on GRAS

\subsection contrib_gras_alnem ALNeM: Application Level Network Mapping

This program is an application-level network mapper. It performs
application level measurements and proposes a few reconstruction
algorithms. 

This program is maintained by Arnaud Legrand, Martin Quinson and
Lionel Eyraud, and is part of the SimGrid SVN (directory
contrib/ALNeM).
