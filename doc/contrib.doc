\section contrib_intro A contrib section ? Why ?

Many people have come to ask us more complex examples than the simple ones
that are distributed with the main branch of the SimGrid project. We do not
want to include complex examples in the main branch but we think it is a
good idea that users share their experience. That is why we have created a
contrib branch that can be used by people who have a nice piece of work
using SimGrid and accept to share it. The licence of this code should be
LGPL if possible. If you can't licence your code with LGPL, just tell us
about it and we will try to sort out whether it makes sense to publish it
here.

\subsection contrib_msg_garsim GarSim

GarSim is a simulator of a scheduling meta-system or just of a batch
system. This code is written in C++ and has many dependencies (with
python, sqlite, some parts of condor, ...). It is maintained by
Vincent Garonne (garonne::lal.in2p3.fr). The cvs directory is <a href="http://gforge.inria.fr/plugins/scmcvs/cvsweb.php/contrib/garSim/?cvsroot=simgrid">here</a>.

\subsection contrib_msg_simbatch Simbatch

This program simulates the behavior of a batch scheduler managing a
cluster. This program is maintained by Jean-Sebastien Gay
(Jean-Sebastien.Gay::ens-lyon.fr). The cvs directory is <a href="http://gforge.inria.fr/plugins/scmcvs/cvsweb.php/contrib/Simbatch/?cvsroot=simgrid">here</a> and the main page is <a href="http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/simbatch/">here</a>.

\dlsubsection contrib_gras_alnem ALNeM: Application Level Network Mapping

This program is an application-level network mapper. It performs application
level measurements and proposes a few reconstruction algorithms. This
program is maintained by Arnaud Legrand (arnaud.legrand::imag.fr) and Martin
Quinson (martin.quinson::loria.fr). The cvs directory is 
<a href="http://gforge.inria.fr/plugins/scmcvs/cvsweb.php/contrib/ALNeM/?cvsroot=cvsroot%2Fsimgrid">here</a>.
