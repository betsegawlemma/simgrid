\section contrib_intro A contrib section ? Why ?

Many people have come to ask us more complex examples than the simple ones
that are distributed with the main branch of the SimGrid project. We do not
want to include complex examples in the main branch but we think it is a
good idea that users share their experience. That is why we have created a
contrib branch that can be used by people who have a nice piece of work
using SimGrid and accept to share it. The licence of this code should be
LGPL if possible. If you can't licence your code with LGPL, just tell us
about it and we will try to sort out whether it makes sense to publish it
here.
