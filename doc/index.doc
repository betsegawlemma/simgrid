\section intro Available Softwares

The SimGrid toolkit is composed of different modules :

\li XBT (eXtensive Bundle of Tools) is a portable library with many
    convenient portable datastructures (vectors, hashtables, heap,
    contexts ...). Most other SimGrid modules rely on it.

\li SURF provides the core functionnalities to simulate a virtual
    platform. It is very low-level and is not intended to be used as
    such but rather to serve as a basis for higher-level simulators
    (like MSG, GRAS, SMPI, ...). It relies on a fast max min linear
    solver.

\li MSG is a simulator built using the previous modules. It aims at
    being realistic and is application-oriented. It is the software layer
    of choice for building simulation with multiple scheduling agents. 

\li GRAS (<em>not functionnal yet</em>) is an ongoing project to emulate virtual 
    virtual platforms through SURF. As a consequence a code developped using the GRAS
    framework is able to run as well in the real-world as in the
    simulator. The resulting code is very portable and highly interoperable while 
    remaining very efficient. Even if you do not plan to run your code for real, 
    you may want to switch to GRAS if you intend to use MSG in a very intensive way
    (e.g. for simulating a peer-to-peer environment).

\li SMPI (<em>not functionnal yet</em>) is an ongoing project to enable MPI code
    to run on top of a virtual platform through SURF. It follows the same principle as
    the ones used in GRAS but is specific to MPI applications.

Here is a figure the depicts the relation between those different modules.

\li <b>Scheduling Distributed Applications: the
       SimGrid Simulation Framework</b>\n
    by <em>Henri Casanova and Arnaud Legrand and Loris Marchal</em>\n
    Proceedings of the third IEEE International Symposium
    on Cluster Computing and the Grid (CCGrid'03)\n
    Since the advent of distributed computer systems an active field
    of research has been the investigation of scheduling strategies
    for parallel applications.  The common approach is to employ
    scheduling heuristics that approximate an optimal
    schedule. Unfortunately, it is often impossible to obtain
    analytical results to compare the efficacy of these heuristics.
    One possibility is to conducts large numbers of back-to-back
    experiments on real platforms.  While this is possible on
    tightly-coupled platforms, it is infeasible on modern distributed
    platforms (i.e. Grids) as it is labor-intensive and does not
    enable repeatable results. The solution is to resort to
    simulations. Simulations not only enables repeatable results but
    also make it possible to explore wide ranges of platform and
    application scenarios.\n
    In this paper we present the SimGrid framework which enables the
    simulation of distributed applications in distributed computing
    environments for the specific purpose of developing and evaluating
    scheduling algorithms.  This paper focuses on SimGrid v2, which
    greatly improves on the first version of the software with more
    realistic network models and topologies.  SimGrid v2 also enables
    the simulation of distributed scheduling agents, which has become
    critical for current scheduling research in large-scale platforms.
    After describing and validating these features, we present a case
    study by which we demonstrate the usefulness of SimGrid for
    conducting scheduling research.


\li <b>A Network Model for Simulation of Grid Application</b>\n
    by <em>Henri Casanova and Loris Marchal</em>\n
    \anchor paper_tcp
    In this work we investigate network models that can be
    potentially employed in the simulation of scheduling algorithms for
    distributed computing applications. We seek to develop a model of TCP
    communication which is both high-level and realistic. Previous research
    works show that accurate and global modeling of wide-area networks, such
    as the Internet, faces a number of challenging issues. However, some
    global models of fairness and bandwidth-sharing exist, and can be link
    withthe behavior of TCP. Using both previous results and simulation (with
    NS), we attempt to understand the macroscopic behavior of
    TCP communications. We then propose a global model of the network for the
    Grid platform. We perform partial validation of this model in
    simulation. The model leads to an algorithm for computing
    bandwidth-sharing. This algorithm can then be implemented as part of Grid
    application simulations. We provide such an implementation for the
    SimGrid simulation toolkit.\n

\li <b>MetaSimGrid : Towards realistic scheduling simulation of
        distributed applications</b>\n
    by <em>Arnaud Legrand and Julien Lerouge</em>\n
    Most scheduling problems are already hard on homogeneous
    platforms, they become quite intractable in an heterogeneous
    framework such as a metacomputing grid. In the best cases, a
    guaranteed heuristic can be found, but most of the time, it is
    not possible. Real experiments or simulations are often
    involved to test or to compare heuristics. However, on a
    distributed heterogeneous platform, such experiments are
    technically difficult to drive, because of the genuine
    instability of the platform. It is almost impossible to
    guarantee that a platform which is not dedicated to the
    experiment, will remain exactly the same between two tests,
    thereby forbidding any meaningful comparison. Simulations are
    then used to replace real experiments, so as to ensure the
    reproducibility of measured data. A key issue is the
    possibility to run the simulations against a realistic
    environment. The main idea of trace-based simulation is to
    record the platform parameters today, and to simulate the
    algorithms tomorrow, against the recorded data: even though it
    is not the current load of the platform, it is realistic,
    because it represents a fair summary of what happened
    previously. A good example of a trace-based simulation tool is
    SimGrid, a toolkit providing a set of core abstractions and
    functionalities that can be used to easily build simulators for
    specific application domains and/or computing environment
    topologies. Nevertheless, SimGrid lacks a number of convenient
    features to craft simulations of a distributed application
    where scheduling decisions are not taken by a single
    process. Furthermore, modeling a complex platform by hand is
    fastidious for a few hosts and is almost impossible for a real
    grid. This report is a survey on simulation for scheduling
    evaluation purposes and present MetaSimGrid, a simulator built
    on top of SimGrid.\n

\li <b>SimGrid: A Toolkit for the Simulation of Application
        Scheduling</b>\n
    by <em>Henri Casanova</em>\n
    Advances in hardware and software technologies have made it
    possible to deploy parallel applications over increasingly large
    sets of distributed resources. Consequently, the study of
    scheduling algorithms for such applications has been an active area
    of research. Given the nature of most scheduling problems one must
    resort to simulation to effectively evaluate and compare their
    efficacy over a wide range of scenarios. It has thus become
    necessary to simulate those algorithms for increasingly complex
    distributed, dynamic, heterogeneous environments. In this paper we
    present SimGrid, a simulation toolkit for the study of scheduling
    algorithms for distributed application. This paper gives the main
    concepts and models behind SimGrid, describes its API and
    highlights current implementation issues. We also give some
    experimental results and describe work that builds on SimGrid's
    functionalities.\n

\li <b>Optimal algorithms for scheduling divisible workloads on
       heterogeneous systems</b>\n
    by <em>Olivier Beaumont and Arnaud Legrand and Yves Robert</em>\n
   In this paper, we discuss several algorithms for scheduling
   divisible loads on heterogeneous systems. Our main contributions
   are (i) new optimality results for single-round algorithms and (ii)
   the design of an asymptotically optimal multi-round algorithm. This
   multi-round algorithm automatically performs resource selection, a
   difficult task that was previously left to the user. Because it is
   periodic, it is simpler to implement, and more robust to changes in
   the speeds of processors or communication links. On the theoretical
   side, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first published
   result assessing the absolute performance of a multi-round
   algorithm.  On the practical side, extensive simulations reveal
   that our multi-round algorithm outperforms existing solutions on a
   large variety of platforms, especially when the
   communication-to-computation ratio is not very high (the difficult
   case).\n
