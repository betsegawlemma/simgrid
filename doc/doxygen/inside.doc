/*! @page uhood_tech Coding Standard and Technical Considerations


There is two main things you want to know about the internals of
SimGrid. First, you need to understand the component organization, as
SimGrid is heavily layered, with each level being rather highly
specialized and optimized toward a task. For that, please head to 
@ref uhood_arch. 

Then, if you work actively on the SimGrid project, the second point
you need to understand is about the infrastructure of the SimGrid
project, ie how to extend the framework in any way, how the automatic
tests are run, and so on. These informations are split on several
pages, as follows:

 - @subpage inside_tests
 - @subpage inside_doxygen
 - @subpage inside_extending
 - @subpage inside_cmake
 - @subpage inside_release

TBD: Coding Standard
