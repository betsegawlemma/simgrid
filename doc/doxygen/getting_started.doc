\tableofcontents

Welcome to the SimGrid's documentation! %As you may know, SimGrid is an actively
developed research software and has a lot of different features. This documentation is a
\c "work in progress" (and we need the help of the user community to improve it! 
If you're ready to step up and help us, see Section \ref
contributing "Contributing"), but many features are already well described.

%As for many projects, our documentation mostly consists in separate sections 
for \ref gs_new_users "new" and \ref gs_experienced_users "experienced" users. 
We also have several specific pages and a technical documentation. Finally, we provide users
with many \ref gs_examples "examples" that can easily be adapted to your
own needs. This page gives you a brief overview of the available resources.

\section gs_introduction Introduction, Installation, and how to get help

| Document name   | Description                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| \ref install    | Explains how SimGrid can be installed on Linux, Windows, and MacOS. This installation can be done from a package or from source. |
| \ref tutorial   | Introduces the user to basic features of SimGrid. |
| \ref FAQ        | Our FAQ                                           |
| \ref help       | There are many ways to find answers to your questions. This page lists them all. |

\section gs_new_users Documentation for new users

| Document name     | Description                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| \ref install      | Explains how SimGrid can be installed on Linux, Windows, and MacOS. This installation can be done from a package or from source. |
| \ref tutorial     | Introduces the user to basic features of SimGrid. |
| [Online Tutorials](http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/tutorials.html) | These tutorials cover most of the basics and might be valuable for what you want to do, especially the [SimGrid User 101](http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/tutorials/simgrid-use-101.pdf). |
| \ref MSG_examples | This page details several examples that we wrote for the MSG API. They are working simulations and you may learn something by looking at them. |
| \ref bindings     | You can write your simulator in Java, if you prefer. |

In order to actually use SimGrid, three steps are necessary:

\li Step 1: \ref platform
\li Step 2: \ref options
\li Step 3: \ref deployment

\section gs_experienced_users Documentation for experienced users

| Document name     | Description                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| \ref tracing      | Shows how the behavior of a program can be written to a file so that it can be analyzed. |
| \ref pls          | You can use the NS3 simulation models instead of our own. |
| \ref inside       | If you want to contribute or obtain a deeper understanding of SimGrid, this is the right location. |

\section gs_examples Examples shipped with SimGrid

SimGrid ships with many examples. Those using the MSG API are detailed in Section \ref
MSG_examples. You can find them in the folder \c examples/. Especially
when you're looking for examples on how to use a specific XML-tag,
this will prove valuable, as you can easily search through all the
files with tools like \c grep.


Here is the output of a quick search for examples for \ref pf_trace "trace_connect":

\verbatim
% grep -R -i -n --include="*.xml" "trace_connect" .
./platforms/two_hosts.xml:17:  <trace_connect trace="Tremblay_power" element="Tremblay" kind="SPEED"/>
./platforms/two_hosts_platform_with_availability_included.xml:26:<trace_connect kind="SPEED" trace="A" element="Cpu A"/>
./platforms/two_hosts_platform_with_availability_included.xml:27:<trace_connect kind="HOST_AVAIL" trace="A_failure" element="Cpu A"/>
./platforms/two_hosts_platform_with_availability_included.xml:28:<trace_connect kind="SPEED" trace="B" element="Cpu B"/>
\endverbatim
