/*! \page pls Packet level simulation

It is possible to use a packet-level network simulator
instead of the default flow-based simulation. You may want to use such
an approach if you have doubts about the validity of the default model
or if you want to perform some validation experiments. 

At the moment, we only support the NS3 simulator. Previous versions of
SimGrid did support the GTNetS simulator and that support could
possibly be revived by someone who would need it.

\section pls_simgrid_configuration_ns3 NS3 as a SimGrid model

You may want to replace the SimGrid network models by the ones of the
well known packet-level network simulator <a href="http://www.nsnam.org/">NS-3</a> instead.
This section explains how to do so.

\subsection pls_simgrid_configuration_ns3_install Installing NS3

The easiest is to install it with the package manager.  Under
Debian/Ubuntu, simply type as root:

\verbatim
apt-get install libns3-dev ns3
\endverbatim

You can also install it from scratch with the following commands:

\verbatim
# Download the source
wget http://www.nsnam.org/release/ns-allinone-3.22.tar.bz2
tar -xf ns-allinone-3.22.tar.bz2
cd ns-allinone-3.22/ns-3.22/
# Configure, build and install
./waf configure --prefix="ns-3_install_directory"
./waf
./waf install
\endverbatim

For more information, please refer to the NS-3 documentation.

\subsection pls_simgrid_configuration_ns3_config Enabling SimGrid's support for NS3

Normally, you just have to enable NS3 in ccmake or cmake as follows.
If you installed NS3 in a regular path, just drop the ns3_path
configuration item.

\verbatim
cmake . -Denable_ns3=ON -Dns3_path=<ns3_path>
\endverbatim

By the end of the configuration, cmake reports whether NS-3 was found.
You can also double-check by executing the tests after the compilation.

\verbatim
$ ctest -R ns3
(several tests should be run)
\endverbatim

If you have a NS3 version that is not known (yet) to SimGrid, the
detection may fail. In that case, edit  the file
tools/cmake/Modules/FindNS3.cmake in your SimGrid tree. The
required changes are very easy, and documented at the beginning of
this file.

If the compilation fails when linking the library because of some .a
file that cannot be used dynamically, that's probably because you only
installed the libns3-dev library on your Debian, where you also need
libns3-3. That's probably a bug of the libns3-dev package that should
depend on the dynamic libraries corresponding to its .so files.

\subsection pls_simgrid_configuration_ns3_use Using NS3 from SimGrid

A working example of NS3/SimGrid interactions can be found in
examples/msg/ns3. Basically, you just have to run your SimGrid
simulation with the configuration option "network/model" set to the
value "NS3". The rest remains unchanged.

The following should work from the examples/msg/ns3 folder (ns3 here
is the name of our example binary).

\verbatim
./ns3 ./3hosts_2links_p.xml 3hosts_2links_d.xml --cfg=network/model:NS3 --log=root.threshold:info
\endverbatim

A ns-3 platform is automatically created from the SimGrid platform
file that you will provide. There is some caveats to know:

<ul>
  <li>The default values (e.g., TCP parameters) are the ns3
    values. Don't blame us for them.</li>  

  <li>NS3 networks are routed using the shortest path algorithm, using
    ns3::Ipv4GlobalRoutingHelper::PopulateRoutingTables.</li>

  <li>End hosts cannot have more than one interface card (so, only one
   &lt;link&gt; in your SimGrid platform should link an end host to
   the platform ; if not, your end host will be considered as a
   router.  </li>
</ul>
