/*! \page deployment Step 3: Deploy the simulation

\section dep_over Overview

When you want to simulate the behavior of your code with SimGrid, you need
to tell SimGrid exactly what code (that you wrote) is supposed to be run by which host - so you need to assign
processes/functions to hosts. The hosts in question here are the hosts of your platform model; see Section \ref platform for details on how to set one up.

This assignment of the form \c code -> \c host is what the deployment file is all about, which will
be discussed briefly here.

\note 
    You can bypass the deployment file by hardcoding it in your user code, at least when you're using
    MSG.

The deployment file looks just like a \ref platform "platform" file, except that in
this case, only two different tags are used: \c process and \c argument, whereas
the latter is just used to supply additional configuration options to the process; the
order in which the \c argument tags are given is important and depends on the application.

### The process tag ###

#### Attribute list ####


\section process_tag Process
There are optional attributes to the process tag, here is a list of all attributes of process: 

| Attribute name  | Mandatory | Values                 | Description                                                                                                               |
| --------------- | --------- | ---------------------- | -----------                                                                                                               |
| host            | yes       | String                 | Describes which host will be used to run this process. The host must be defined in the platform file!                     |
| process         | yes       | String                 | Name of a function that will be executed on this host. This is any function that was registered by #MSG_register_function |
| start_time      | no        | int (Default: 0)       | The simulated time when this function will start to be computed.                                                          |
| kill_time       | no        | int                    | The simulated time when this function will end to be computed. By default, it stops only when it's done.                  |

### An example ###

A complete example including a \ref MSG_ext_ms_application "deployment file" can be found 
in the Section \ref MSG_ex_basics "MSG basics".
