/*! @page involved Getting involved

This page does not exist yet, and a good way to get involved may be to
first help improving the documentation (FIXME).

The <a href="https://gforge.inria.fr/tracker/?atid=165&group_id=12&func=browse">Bug
Tracking System</a> is probably the best way to help us. Please report
there any issue that you notice, and please help us fixing the bugs.
