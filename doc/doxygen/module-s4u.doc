/**
@defgroup s4u_api  S4U: Next Generation SimGrid API
@brief Future core API, mixing the full power of SimGrid to the power of C++. 

The S4U API is currently under heavy work, but will eventually
deprecate the MSG and SimDag APIs. Everything that you can do in
SimGrid will be possible in S4U. 

@warning <b>S4U is not ready for public use yet</b>. You should not go
	 that path unless you know what you are doing.  If unsure,
	 proceed to @ref MSG_API instead.


Unsurprisingly, the S4U interface matches the concepts presented in 
@ref starting_components "the introduction". You should read this page
first, to not get lost in the amount of classes provided here.
