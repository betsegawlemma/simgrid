\section ci_jenkins Jenkins Interface

\subsection inside_jenkins_basics Where can I find Jenkins?

The SimGrid team currently uses Jenkins to automate testing. Our Jenkins
interface can be found here: https://ci.inria.fr/simgrid/

If you need an account, talk to Martin Quinson.

\subsection inside_jenkins_add_host How can I add a new host?

You have to login to the CI interface of INRIA: https://ci.inria.fr
There you can manage the project and add new nodes.

\subsection inside_jenkins_reboot_host How can I restart / reboot a host?

Exactly the same as in \ref inside_jenkins_add_host. The only exception
is that you have to click on "restart" of the host you want to restart.


\subsection inside_jenkins_config_matrix Disable a certain build in the configuration matrix

Jenkins uses a configuration matrix, i.e., a matrix consisting of configurations
on the one axis and hosts on the other. Normally, every host will try to build
every configuration but this may not be desirable.

In order to disable a single configuration for a specific host (but leave
other configurations for the same host enabled), go to your Project and click
on "Configuration". There, find the field "combination filter" (if your interface
language is English) and tick the checkbox; then add a groovy-expression to
disable a specific configuration. For example, in order to disable the "ModelChecker"
build on host "small-freebsd-64-clang", use:

\verbatim
(label=="small-freebsd-64-clang").implies(build_mode!="ModelChecker")
\endverbatim

\section ci_servers CI Servers

\subsection ci_servers_build_dir Where is SimGrid built?

SimGrid gets built in /builds/workspace/$PROJECT/build_mode/$CONFIG/label/$SERVER/build

Here, $PROJECT could be for instance "SimGrid-Multi", $CONFIG "DEBUG" or "ModelChecker"
and $SERVER for instance "simgrid-fedora20-64-clang".
