/*! @page install Installing Simgrid

@tableofcontents

SimGrid should work out of the box on Linux, Mac OSX, FreeBSD, and Windows (under windows, only the Java interfaces are
available at the moment).

The easiest way to install SimGrid is to go for a @ref install_binary "binary package". Under Debian or Ubuntu, this is 
very easy as SimGrid is directly integrated to the official repositories. For other Linux variants, you probably want 
to go for a @ref install_src "source install". Please contact us if you want to contribute the build scripts for your 
preferred distribution. If you just want to use @ref install_binary_java "Java", simply copy the jar file on your disk 
and you're set.

@section install_binary Pre-compiled Packages

@subsection install_binary_linux Binaries for Linux

Most of us use a Debian or Ubuntu system, so the packages for these
systems are well integrated and up-to-date. To get these packages, simply type:

@verbatim
apt-get install simgrid
@endverbatim

@subsection install_binary_java Stable Java Package 

For the SimGrid Java bindings, grab the jar file from the [download
page](https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/?group_id=12) and copy it in your
classpath (typically, your source code root directory). This
self-contained version even includes the SimGrid native components for
the following architectures: Linux (Amd64, x86, Arm), Mac OS X 64
bits, Windows 64 bits, FreeBSD (64 bits).

@subsection install_binary_java_builder Nightly built Java Package

For Windows, head to [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mquinson/simgrid).
Click on the artefact link on the right, and grab your file. If the latest build failed, there will be no artefact. Then
you will need to first click on "History" on the top and search for the last successful build.

For non-Windows systems (Linux, Mac or FreeBSD), head to [Jenkins](https://ci.inria.fr/simgrid/job/SimGrid-Multi).
In the build history, pick the last green (or at least yellow) build that is not blinking (i.e., not currently under 
build). In the list, pick a system that is close to yours, and click on the ball in the Debug row. The build artefact 
will appear on the top of the resulting page.

@subsection install_binary_java_troubleshooting Binary Java Troubleshooting

 - **Your architecture is not supported by this jarfile**. \n
   If your system is in the list of the supported architectures (see
   @ref install_binary_java "above"), then this is probably a bug that 
   @ref contributing_bugs "you should report".\n
   If your system is actually not supported, you should compile your
   own jarfile @ref install_src "by compiling SimGrid" on your
   machine. If you feel so, @ref community_contact "contact us" so that we add
   your architecture to the list.

 - **Library not found: boost-context**.\n 
   You should obviously install the @c boost-context library on your
   machine, for example with @c apt-get.

@section install_src Source Installs

@subsection install_src_deps Getting the Dependencies

Recompiling an official archive is not much more complex. SimGrid only uses very standard tools:
  - C compiler, C++ compiler, make and friends.
  - perl (but you may try to go without it)
  - We use cmake to configure our compilation
      ([download page](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)).
      You need cmake version 2.8.8 or higher. You may want to use ccmake
      for a graphical interface over cmake.
  - boost:
    - Max OS X: with [fink](http://www.finkproject.org/): `fink install boost1.53.nopython`,
      or with homebrew: `brew install boost`
    - Debian / Ubuntu: `apt-get install libboost-dev libboost-context-dev`
  - Java (if you want to build the Java bindings): Grab a
    [full JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads)

For platform-specific details, please see  @ref install_cmake_mac,
@ref install_cmake_windows and @ref install_src_32bits

@subsection install_src_fetch Getting the Sources

You can download the *@SimGridRelease.tar.gz* archive from the 
[download page](https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/?group_id=12).
Then, recompiling the archive should be done in a few lines:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.sh}
tar xf @SimGridRelease.tar.gz
cd @SimGridRelease
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/simgrid .
make
make install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to stay on the bleeding edge, you should get the latest git version, and recompile it as you would do for 
an official archive. Depending on the files you change in the source tree, some extra tools may be needed.

@verbatim
git clone git://scm.gforge.inria.fr/simgrid/simgrid.git simgrid
@endverbatim

@subsection install_src_config Build Configuration

Note that compile-time options are very different from @ref options "run-time options".

@subsubsection install_cmake_howto Compilation Options

The default configuration should be fine for most usages, but if you need to change something, there are several ways 
to do so. First, you can use environment variables. For example, you can change the compilers used by issuing these 
commands before launching cmake:

@verbatim
export CC=gcc-4.7
export CXX=g++-4.7
@endverbatim

Note that other variables are available, such as CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS to add options respectively for the C and C++ 
compilers.

Another way to do so is to use the -D argument of cmake as follows.
Note that the ending dot is mandatory (see @ref install_cmake_outsrc).

@verbatim
cmake -DCC=clang -DCXX=clang++ .
@endverbatim

Finally, you can use the ccmake graphical interface to change these settings. 

@verbatim
ccmake .
@endverbatim

@subsubsection install_cmake_list SimGrid compilation options

In addition to the classical cmake configuration variables, SimGrid accepts several options, as listed below.

  @li <b>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</b> (path): Where to install SimGrid (/opt/simgrid, /usr/local, or elsewhere).

  @li <b>enable_compile_optimizations</b> (ON/OFF) to request the compiler to produce efficient code. You want to 
      activate it, unless you plan to debug SimGrid itself. Indeed, efficient code may be appear mangled to debuggers.

  @li <b>enable_compile_warnings</b> (ON/OFF) to request the compiler to issue error messages whenever the source code
      is not perfectly clean. If you are a SimGrid developer, you have to activate this option to enforce the code 
      quality. As a regular user, this option will bring you nothing.

  @li <b>enable_debug</b> (ON/OFF). Disable this option toto discard
      all log messages of gravity debug or below at compile time (see
      @ref XBT_log). The resulting code is faster than if you
      discarding these messages at runtime. However, it obviously
      becomes impossible to get any debug info from SimGrid if
      something goes wrong.

  @li <b>enable_documentation</b> (ON/OFF) to generate the documentation pages.

  @li <b>enable_java</b> (ON/OFF) to enjoy the java bindings of SimGrid.

  @li <b>enable_jedule</b> (ON/OFF) to get SimDag producing execution traces that can then be visualized with the 
      Jedule external tool.

  @li <b>enable_lua</b> (ON/OFF) to enjoy the lua bindings to the
      SimGrid internals.

  @li <b>enable_lib_in_jar</b> (ON/OFF) to make sure that the native
      java bindings are bundled in the jar file.

  @li <b>enable_lto</b> (ON/OFF) to enable the Link Time Optimization
      of the C compiler. This feature really speeds up the produced
      code, but it is fragile with some versions of GCC.

  @li <b>enable_maintainer_mode</b> (ON/OFF) is only needed if you plan to modify very specific parts of SimGrid
      (e.g., the XML parsers and other related elements). Moreover, this adds an extra dependency on flex and flexml.

  @li <b>enable_mallocators</b> (ON/OFF) has to be disabled when tracking memory issues within SimGrid, or the caching 
      mechanism used internally will fool the debuggers.

  @li <b>enable_model-checking</b> (ON/OFF) if you actually plan to
      use the model-checking feature of SimGrid. This execution mode
      is very usable now, but enabling this option at compile time
      will **hinder simulation speed** even when the model-checker is
      not activated at run time.

  @li <b>enable_ns3</b> (ON/OFF) if you want to use ns-3. See section @ref pls_ns3.

  @li <b>enable_smpi</b> (ON/OFF) to run MPI code on top of SimGrid.

  @li <b>enable_smpi_ISP_testsuite</b> (ON/OFF) to add many extra
      tests for the model-checker module.

  @li <b>enable_smpi_MPICH3_testsuite</b> (ON/OFF) to add many extra
      tests for the MPI module.

@subsubsection install_cmake_reset Reset the build configuration

To empty the cmake cache (either when you add a new library or when
things go seriously wrong), simply delete your @c CMakeCache.txt. You
may also want to directly edit this file in some circumstances.

@subsubsection install_cmake_outsrc Out of Tree Compilation

By default, the files produced during the compilation are placed in
the source directory. It is however often better to put them all in a
separate directory: cleaning the tree becomes as easy as removing this
directory, and you can have several such directories to test several
parameter sets or architectures.

For that, go to the directory where the files should be produced, and
invoke cmake (or ccmake) with the full path to the SimGrid source as
last argument.

@verbatim
mkdir build
cd build
cmake [options] ..
make
@endverbatim

@subsubsection install_cmake_mac Mac OS X Builds

SimGrid compiles like a charm with clang (version 3.0 or higher) on Mac OS X:

@verbatim
cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/clang++ .
make
@endverbatim

With the XCode version of clang 4.1, you may get the following error message:
@verbatim
CMake Error: Parse error in cache file build_dir/CMakeCache.txt. Offending entry: /SDKs/MacOSX10.8.sdk
@endverbatim

In that case, edit the CMakeCache.txt file directly, so that the
CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT is similar to the following. Don't worry about the
warning that the "-pthread" argument is not used, if it appears.
@verbatim
CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT:PATH=/Applications/XCode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer
@endverbatim

In the El Capitan version of Max OS X, Apple decided that users don't
need no /usr/include directory anymore. If you are hit by this pure
madness, just run the following command to restore that classical
UNIX directory: `xcode-select -install`

@subsubsection install_cmake_windows Windows Builds

Building SimGrid on Windows may be something of an adventure:
We only manage to  do so ourselves with MinGW-64, <a
href="http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads">ActiveState</a>
Perl and <a href="http://msysgit.googlecode.com/files/Git-1.7.4-preview20110204.exe">msys</a>
git). Have a look at out configuration scripts in @c appveyor.yml, but
don't expect too much  from us: we are really not fluent with Windows.
Actually your help is welcome.

The drawback of MinGW-64 is that the produced DLL are not compatible
with MS Visual C. <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/MSVCCompatibility.html">clang-cl</a>
sounds promising to fix this. If you get something working, please
@ref community_contact "tell us".

@subsubsection install_src_32bits 32 bits Builds on Multi-arch Linux

On a multiarch x86_64 Linux, it should be possible to compile a 32 bit
version of SimGrid with something like:

@verbatim
CFLAGS=-m32 \
CXXFLAGS=-m32 \
PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/pkgconfig/ \
cmake . \
-DCMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR=i386 \
-DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=/some/path/to/i686-linux-gnu-gfortran \
-DGFORTRAN_EXE=/some/path/to/i686-linux-gnu-gfortran \
-DCMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS=-m32
@endverbatim

If needed, implement @c i686-linux-gnu-gfortran as a script:

@verbatim
#!/bin/sh
exec gfortran -m32 "$@"
@endverbatim

@subsection install_src_compil Existing Compilation Targets

In most cases, compiling and installing SimGrid is enough:

@verbatim
make
make install # try "sudo make install" if you don't have the permission to write
@endverbatim

In addition, several compilation targets are provided in SimGrid. If
your system is well configured, the full list of targets is available
for completion when using the Tab key. Note that some of the existing
targets are not really for public consumption so don't worry if some
stuff doesn't work for you.

@verbatim
make simgrid			Build only the SimGrid library and not any example
make app-masterworker		Build only this example (works for any example)
make clean			Clean the results of a previous compilation
make install 			Install the project (doc/ bin/ lib/ include/)
make uninstall			Uninstall the project (doc/ bin/ lib/ include/)
make dist			Build a distribution archive (tgz)
make distcheck			Check the dist (make + make dist + tests on the distribution)
make documentation		Create SimGrid documentation
@endverbatim

If you want to see what is really happening, try adding VERBOSE=1 to
your compilation requests:

@verbatim
make VERBOSE=1
@endverbatim

@subsection install_src_test Testing your build

Once everything is built, you may want to test the result. SimGrid
comes with an extensive set of regression tests (as described in the
@ref inside_tests "insider manual"). The tests are run with @c ctest, that comes with CMake.
We run them every commit and the results are on [our
Jenkins](https://ci.inria.fr/simgrid/).

@verbatim
ctest		 	  # Launch all tests
ctest -R msg              # Launch only the tests which name match the string "msg"
ctest -j4                 # Launch all tests in parallel, at most 4 at the same time
ctest --verbose           # Display all details on what's going on
ctest --output-on-failure # Only get verbose for the tests that fail

ctest -R msg- -j5 --output-on-failure # You changed MSG and want to check that you didn't break anything, huh?
                                      # That's fine, I do so all the time myself.
@endverbatim

@section install_setting_own Setting up your own code

Directly modifying the SimGrid examples will make it harder to upgrade
to the next version of SimGrid. Instead, you should create your own
working directory somewhere on your disk
(say `/home/joe/MyFirstScheduler/`).

Here is a Makefile that will work if your project is composed of three
C files named @c util.h, @c util.c and @c mysimulator.c. You should
take it as a starting point, and adapt it to your code. There is a
plenty of documentation and tutorial on Makefile if the file's
comments are not enough for you.

@verbatim
# The first rule of a Makefile is the default target. It will be built when make is called with no parameter
# Here, we want to build the binary 'mysimulator'
all: mysimulator

# This second rule lists the dependencies of the mysimulator binary
# How this dependencies are linked is described in an implicit rule below
mysimulator: mysimulator.o util.o

# These third give the dependencies of the each source file
mysimulator.o: mysimulator.c util.h # list every .h that you use
util.o: util.c util.h

# Some configuration
SIMGRID_INSTALL_PATH = /opt/simgrid # Where you installed simgrid
CC = gcc                            # Your compiler

# CFLAGS = -g -O0 $(WARNINGS) # Use this line to make debugging easier
CFLAGS = -g -O2 $(WARNINGS) # Use this line to get better performance

#############################################
# The following are implicit rules, used by default to actually build

.PHONY: clean
@endverbatim

@subsection install_setting_own_trouble Troubleshooting your code setup

Sometimes, the following error message (or similar) will be produced.
@verbatim
masterworker.c:209: undefined reference to `sg_version_check'
masterworker.c:209: undefined reference to `MSG_init_nocheck'
(and possibly many other undefined references)
@endverbatim

It means that the system does not manage to find simgrid when it tries
to execute your programs. Specify where to search with the
<tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt> variable. Try running the following command
before executing your code. If it helps, you should add this line to
your ~/.bashrc so that it gets executed each time you log into your
computer.

@verbatim
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/simgrid/lib
@endverbatim
