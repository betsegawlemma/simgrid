SimGrid comes with many examples provided in the examples/ directory.
Those examples are described in section \ref MSG_examples. Those
examples are commented and should be easy to understand. for a first
step into SimGrid we also provide some more detailed examples in the
sections below.

Here are some examples on how to use MSG, the most used API.

MSG comes with an extensive set of examples. It is sometimes difficult
to find the one you need. This list aims at helping you finding the
example from which you can learn what you want to.

\subsection MSG_ex_basics Basic examples and features

\subsubsection MSG_ex_asynchronous_communications Asynchronous communications


Simulation of asynchronous communications between a sender and a receiver using a realistic platform and
an external description of the deployment.

<hr>

\dontinclude msg/icomms/peer.c

\paragraph MSG_ext_icomms_code Code of the application

\paragraph MSG_ext_icomms_preliminary Preliminary declarations
\skip include
\until Sender function

\paragraph MSG_ext_icomms_Sender Sender function

A host can send an an asynchronous message with \c MSG_task_isend(). %As this function is non-blocking,
we have to call \c MSG_comm_test() to know if the communication has finished and finally destroy it with a call to \c MSG_comm_destroy().
It is also possible to call \c MSG_comm_wait() which, is provides a shortcut.

  C style arguments (argc/argv) are interpreted as:
   - the number of tasks to distribute
   - the computation size of each task
   - the size of the files associated to each task
   - a list of host that will accept those tasks.
   - the time to sleep at the beginning of the function
   - This time defined the process sleep time
			if time = 0 use of MSG_comm_wait()
			if time > 0 use of MSG_comm_test()


\until Receiver function

\paragraph MSG_ext_icomms_Receiver Receiver function

This function executes tasks when it receives them. %As the receiving is asynchronous we have to test the communication to know
if it is completed or not with \c MSG_comm_test() or wait for the completion \c MSG_comm_wait().

  C style arguments (argc/argv) are interpreted as:
   - the id to use for received the communication.
   - the time to sleep at the beginning of the function
   - This time defined the process sleep time
			if time = 0 use of MSG_comm_wait()
			if time > 0 use of MSG_comm_test()

\until Test function

\paragraph MSG_ext_icomms_core Simulation core

  This function is the core of the simulation and is divided only into 3 parts
  thanks to MSG_create_environment() and MSG_launch_application().
     -# Simulation settings : MSG_create_environment() creates a realistic
        environment
     -# Application deployment : create the processes on the right locations with
        MSG_launch_application()
     -# The simulation is run with #MSG_main()

  Its arguments are:
	- <i>platform_file</i>: the name of a file containing an valid surfxml platform description.
	- <i>application_file</i>: the name of a file containing a valid surfxml application description

\until Main function

\paragraph MSG_ext_icomms_Main Main function

This initializes MSG, runs a simulation, and free all data-structures created by MSG.

\until end_of_main

\dontinclude msg/icomms/peer2.c

\paragraph MSG_ext_icomms_fct_Waitall Waitall function for sender

The use of this function permit to send all messages and wait for the completion of all in one time.

\skipline Sender function
\until end_of_sender

\paragraph MSG_ext_icomms_fct_Waitany Waitany function

The MSG_comm_waitany() function return the place of the first message send or receive from a xbt_dynar_t table.

\paragraph MSG_ext_icomms_fct_Waitany_sender From a sender
We can use this function to wait all sent messages.
\dontinclude msg/icomms/peer3.c
\skipline Sender function
\until end_of_sender

\paragraph MSG_ext_icomms_fct_Waitany_receiver From a receiver
We can also wait for the arrival of all messages.
\dontinclude msg/icomms/peer3.c
\skipline Receiver function
\until end_of_receiver

\subsubsection MSG_ex_master_slave Basic Master/Slaves

Simulation of a master-slave application using a realistic platform
and an external description of the deployment.

\paragraph MSG_ext_ms_preliminary Preliminary declarations

\skip include
\until printf
\until }

\paragraph MSG_ext_ms_master Master code

This function has to be assigned to a #msg_process_t that will behave as
the master. It should not be called directly but either given as a
parameter to #MSG_process_create() or registered as a public function
through #MSG_function_register() and then automatically assigned to a
process through #MSG_launch_application().

C style arguments (argc/argv) are interpreted as:
   - the number of tasks to distribute
   - the computation size of each task
   - the size of the files associated to each task
   - a list of host that will accept those tasks.

Tasks are dumbly sent in a round-robin style.

\until end_of_master

\paragraph MSG_ext_ms_slave Slave code

This function has to be assigned to a #msg_process_t that has to behave
as a slave. Just like the master function (described in \ref
MSG_ext_ms_master), it should not be called directly.

This function keeps waiting for tasks and executes them as it receives them.

\until end_of_slave

\paragraph MSG_ext_ms_forwarder Forwarder code

This function has to be assigned to a #msg_process_t that has to behave
as a forwarder. Just like the master function (described in \ref
MSG_ext_ms_master), it should not be called directly.

C style arguments (argc/argv) are interpreted as a list of hosts that
will accept those tasks.

This function keeps waiting for tasks and dispatches them to its slaves.

\until end_of_forwarder

\paragraph MSG_ext_ms_core Simulation core

This function is the core of the simulation and is divided only into 3 parts
thanks to MSG_create_environment() and MSG_launch_application().
   -# Simulation settings : MSG_create_environment() creates a realistic
      environment
   -# Application deployment : create the processes on the right locations with
      MSG_launch_application()
   -# The simulation is run with #MSG_main()

Its arguments are:
	- <i>platform_file</i>: the name of a file containing an valid surfxml platform description.
	- <i>application_file</i>: the name of a file containing a valid surfxml application description

\until end_of_test_all

\paragraph MSG_ext_ms_main Main() function

This initializes MSG, runs a simulation, and free all data-structures created by MSG.

\until end_of_main
