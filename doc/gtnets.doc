\section gtnets_simgrid_configuration_gtnets Using GTNetS

It is possible to use a packet-level network simulator
instead of the default flow-based simulation. You may want to use such
an approach if you have doubts about the validity of the default model
or if you want to perform some validation experiments. At the moment,
we support the GTNetS simulator (it is still rather experimental
though, so leave us a message if you play with it). 

<i>
To enable GTNetS model inside SimGrid it is needed to patch the GTNetS simulator source code 
and build/install it from scratch
</i>

 - <b>Download and enter the recent downloaded GTNetS directory</b>

 \verbatim
 svn checkout svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/simgrid/contrib/trunk/GTNetS/
 cd GTNetS
 \endverbatim


 - <b>Use the following commands to unzip and patch GTNetS package to work within SimGrid.</b>

 \verbatim
 unzip gtnets-current.zip
 tar zxvf gtnets-current-patch.tgz 
 cd gtnets-current
 cat ../00*.patch | patch -p1
 \endverbatim

  - <b>OPTIONALLY</b> you can use a patch for itanium 64bit processor family.

  \verbatim
  cat ../AMD64-FATAL-Removed-DUL_SIZE_DIFF-Added-fPIC-compillin.patch | patch -p1
  \endverbatim

 - <b>Compile GTNetS</b>

   Due to portability issues it is possible that GTNetS does not compile in your architecture. The patches furnished in SimGrid SVN repository are intended for use in Linux architecture only. Unfortunately, we do not have the time, the money, neither the manpower to guarantee GTNetS portability. We advice you to use one of GTNetS communication channel to get more help in compiling GTNetS. 


 \verbatim
 ln -sf Makefile.linux Makefile
 make depend
 make debug
 \endverbatim


 - <b>NOTE</b> A lot of warnings are expected but the application should compile
 just fine. If the makefile insists in compiling some QT libraries
 please try a make clean before asking for help.


 - <b>To compile optimized version</b>

 \verbatim
 make opt
 \endverbatim


 - <b>Installing GTNetS</b>

 It is important to put the full path of your libgtsim-xxxx.so file when creating the symbolic link. Replace < userhome > by some path you have write access to.

 \verbatim
 ln -sf /<absolute_path>/gtnets_current/libgtsim-debug.so /<userhome>/usr/lib/libgtnets.so
 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/<userhome>/usr/lib/libgtnets.so
 mkdir /<userhome>/usr/include/gtnets
 cp -fr SRC/*.h /<userhome>/usr/include/gtnets
 \endverbatim


 - <b>Enable GTNetS support in SimGrid</b>
 
In order to enable gtnets with simgrid you have to give where is gtnets. (path to \<gtnets_path\>/lib and \<gtnets_path\>/include)

   \verbatim
   Since v3.4 (with cmake)
   cmake . -Dgtnets_path=/<userhome>/usr
   
   Until v3.4 (with autotools)
   ./configure --with-gtnets=/<userhome>/usr
   \endverbatim

 - <b>Once you have followed all the instructions for compiling and
   installing successfully you can activate this feature at 
   runntime with the following options:</b>

   \verbatim
   Since v3.4 (with cmake)
   cd simgrid
   make
   ctest -R gtnets
   
   Until v3.4 (with autotools)
   cd simgrid/example/msg/
   make
   make check
   \endverbatim


 - <b>Or try the GTNetS model dogbone example with</b>

 \verbatim
 gtnets/gtnets gtnets/onelink-p.xml gtnets/onelink-d.xml --cfg=network_model:GTNets
 \endverbatim

 - <b>DISCLAIMER</b>
 The patches provided by us worked successfully with GTNetS found 
 <a href="http://www.ece.gatech.edu/research/labs/MANIACS/GTNetS/software/gtnets-current.zip">here</a>, 
 dated from 12th June 2008. Due to the discontinuing development of
 GTNetS it is impossible to precise a version number. We STRONGLY recommend you
 to download and install the GTNetS version found in SimGrid repository as explained above.
