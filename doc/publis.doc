\li <b>SimGrid: a Generic Framework for Large-Scale Distributed
    Experimentations</b>\n 
    by <em>Henri Casanova, Arnaud Legrand and Martin Quinson</em>\n
    Proceedings of the 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer
    Modelling and Simulation (UKSIM/EUROSIM'08)\n    
    Distributed computing is a very broad and active research area
    comprising fields such as cluster computing, computational
    grids, desktop grids and peer-to-peer (P2P) systems.
    Unfortunately, it is often impossible to obtain theoretical or
    analytical results to compare the performance of algorithms
    targeting such systems. One possibility is to conduct large
    numbers of back-to-back experiments on real platforms. While
    this is possible on tightly-coupled platforms, it is infeasible
    on modern distributed platforms as experiments are labor-intensive
    and results typically not reproducible. Consequently, one must
    resort to simulations, which enable reproducible results and also
    make it possible to explore wide ranges of platform and
    application scenarios.\n
    In this paper we describe the SimGrid framework, a
    simulation-based framework for evaluating cluster, grid and P2P
    algorithms and heuristics. This paper focuses on SimGrid v3, which
    greatly improves on previous versions thanks to a novel and
    validated modular simulation engine that achieves higher
    simulation speed without hindering simulation accuracy. Also, two
    new user interfaces were added to broaden the targeted research
    community. After surveying existing tools and methodologies we
    describe the key features and benefits of SimGrid.\n

\section publis_others Other publications

A lot of other papers where published about SimGrid. The list is
splited in 3 pages (also accessible from the navbar on top of this page):
 - \ref publis_core\n
   This section contains papers describing some sub-parts of SimGrid,
   or references superseeded by the one given above.
 - \ref publis_extern\n
   SimGrid is used by an ever growing scientific community. This
   section lists all the papers resulting of works in which the core
   SimGrid team were not involved.
 - \ref publis_intra\n
   This section lists the paper co-signed by at least one of the core
   team member, and using SimGrid as a tool (and not studying SimGrid
   itself).
