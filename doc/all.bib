  abstract =     {In this work we investigate network models that can be
    potentially employed in the simulation of scheduling algorithms for
    distributed computing applications. We seek to develop a model of TCP
    communication which is both high-level and realistic. Previous research
    works show that accurate and global modeling of wide-area networks, such
    as the Internet, faces a number of challenging issues. However, some
    global models of fairness and bandwidth-sharing exist, and can be link
    withthe behavior of TCP. Using both previous results and simulation (with
    NS), we attempt to understand the macroscopic behavior of
    TCP communications. We then propose a global model of the network for the
    Grid platform. We perform partial validation of this model in
    simulation. The model leads to an algorithm for computing
    bandwidth-sharing. This algorithm can then be implemented as part of Grid
    application simulations. We provide such an implementation for the
    SimGrid simulation toolkit.},

  title = 	 {MetaSimGrid : Towards realistic scheduling simulation of distributed applications},
  institution =  {LIP, ENS Lyon, France},
  year = 	 {2002},
  abstract =     {Most scheduling problems are already hard on homogeneous
    platforms, they become quite intractable in an heterogeneous
    framework such as a metacomputing grid. In the best cases, a
    guaranteed heuristic can be found, but most of the time, it is
    not possible. Real experiments or simulations are often
    involved to test or to compare heuristics. However, on a
    distributed heterogeneous platform, such experiments are
    technically difficult to drive, because of the genuine
    instability of the platform. It is almost impossible to
    guarantee that a platform which is not dedicated to the
    experiment, will remain exactly the same between two tests,
    thereby forbidding any meaningful comparison. Simulations are
    then used to replace real experiments, so as to ensure the
    reproducibility of measured data. A key issue is the
    possibility to run the simulations against a realistic
    environment. The main idea of trace-based simulation is to
    record the platform parameters today, and to simulate the
    algorithms tomorrow, against the recorded data: even though it
    is not the current load of the platform, it is realistic,
    because it represents a fair summary of what happened
    previously. A good example of a trace-based simulation tool is
    SimGrid, a toolkit providing a set of core abstractions and
    functionalities that can be used to easily build simulators for
    specific application domains and/or computing environment
    topologies. Nevertheless, SimGrid lacks a number of convenient
    features to craft simulations of a distributed application
    where scheduling decisions are not taken by a single
    process. Furthermore, modeling a complex platform by hand is
    fastidious for a few hosts and is almost impossible for a real
    grid. This report is a survey on simulation for scheduling
    evaluation purposes and present MetaSimGrid, a simulator built
    on top of SimGrid.},

  abstract = {Advances in hardware and software technologies have made it
    possible to deploy parallel applications over increasingly large
    sets of distributed resources. Consequently, the study of
    scheduling algorithms for such applications has been an active area
    of research. Given the nature of most scheduling problems one must
    resort to simulation to effectively evaluate and compare their
    efficacy over a wide range of scenarios. It has thus become
    necessary to simulate those algorithms for increasingly complex
    distributed, dynamic, heterogeneous environments. In this paper we
    present SimGrid, a simulation toolkit for the study of scheduling
    algorithms for distributed application. This paper gives the main
    concepts and models behind SimGrid, describes its API and
    highlights current implementation issues. We also give some
    experimental results and describe work that builds on SimGrid's
    functionalities.},
