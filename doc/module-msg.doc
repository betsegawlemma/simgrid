    \section MSG_ext_ms_code Code of the application
    
    \subsection MSG_ext_ms_preliminary Preliminary declarations
    
    \skip include
    \until printf
    \until }
    
    \subsection MSG_ext_ms_master Master code
    
      This function has to be assigned to a m_process_t that will behave as the master.
      It should not be called directly but either given as a parameter to
      #MSG_process_create() or registered as a public function through 
      #MSG_function_register() and then automatically assigned to a process through
      #MSG_launch_application().
 
      C style arguments (argc/argv) are interpreted as:
       - the number of tasks to distribute
       - the computation size of each task
       - the size of the files associated to each task
       - a list of host that will accept those tasks.

      Tasks are dumbly sent in a round-robin style.
      
      \until end_of_master
    
    \subsection MSG_ext_ms_slave Slave code
    
      This function has to be assigned to a #m_process_t that has to behave as a slave.
      Just like #master(), it should not be called directly.

      This function keeps waiting for tasks and executes them as it receives them.
      
      \until end_of_slave

   \subsection MSG_ext_ms_forwarder Forwarder code
   
      This function has to be assigned to a #m_process_t that has to behave as a forwarder.
      Just like #master(), it should not be called directly.

      C style arguments (argc/argv) are interpreted as a list of host
      that will accept those tasks.

      This function keeps waiting for tasks and dispathes them to its slaves.

   \subsection MSG_ext_ms_core Simulation core

      This function is the core of the simulation and is divided only into 3 parts
      thanks to MSG_create_environment() and MSG_launch_application().
         -# Simulation settings : MSG_create_environment() creates a realistic 
            environment
         -# Application deployment : create the agents on the right locations with  
            MSG_launch_application()
         -# The simulation is run with #MSG_main()
	 
      Its arguments are:
	- <i>platform_file</i>: the name of a file containing an valid surfxml platform description.
	- <i>application_file</i>: the name of a file containing a valid surfxml application description
	
      \until end_of_test_all
      
   \subsection MSG_ext_ms_main Main() function
   
      This initializes MSG, runs a simulation, and free all data-structures created by MSG.
      
      \until end_of_main
