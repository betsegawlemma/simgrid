\section use_generic First steps with SimGrid

If you decide to go for the MSG interface, please read carefully the
\ref MSG_examples. You'll find in \ref MSG_ex_master_slave a very
simple consisting of a master (that owns a bunch of tasks and
distributes them) , some slaves (that process tasks whenever they
receive one) and some forwarder agents (that simply pass the tasks
they receive to some slaves).

If you decide to go for the GRAS interface, you should definitively
read the \ref GRAS_tut. The first section constitutes an introduction
to the tool and presents the model we use. The second section
constitutes a complete step-by-step tutorial building a distributed
application from the beginning and exemplifying most of the GRAS
features in the process. The last section groups some HOWTOS
highlighting a given feature of the framework in a more concise way.

If you decide to go for another interface, I'm afraid your only sources
of information will be the source code and the mailing lists...
