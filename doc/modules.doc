/** \defgroup SURF_API       SURF
    \ingroup SimGrid_API
    \brief Kernel of all the simulators used in SimGrid, and associated models.
 
      SURF provides the core functionnalities to simulate a virtual
      platform. It is very low-level and is not intended to be used as
      such but rather to serve as a basis for higher-level simulators.
      We're still working on it and the structure is a little bit
      complex. So we'll document it only when we'll be completely satisfied of 
      the way it is organized.

      It is where platform models are encoded. If you need a model that is not 
      encoded yet, please tell me (<arnaud.legrand@imag.fr>) and we'll
      see if it is feasible or not (hopefully it should be but who knows).

      Please note that as it is not really intended for public use,
      this module is only partially documented.

/** \defgroup MSG_API      MSG
    \ingroup SimGrid_API
    \brief Simple programming environment 
  
      MSG was the first distributed programming environment provided within
      SimGrid. While almost realistic, it remains quite simple (simplistic?).

      \section MSG_who Who should use this (and who shouldn't)
      
      You should use this module if you want to study some heuristics for a
      given problem you don't really want to implement. If you want to get a
      real implementation of your solution, have a look at the \ref GRAS_API 
      programming environment. If you want to study an existing MPI program,
      have a look at the \ref SMPI_API one. If none of those programming
      environments fits your needs, you may consider implementing your own 
      directly on top of \ref SURF_API (but you probably want to contact us
      before).

/** \defgroup GRAS_API      GRAS
    \ingroup SimGrid_API
    \brief Realistic programming environment (Grid Reality And Simulation)
  
    GRAS provides a complete API to implement distributed application on top
    of heterogeneous plateforms. In addition to the SimGrid implementation
    of this interface (allowing you to work on your application within the
    comfort of the simulator), an implementation suited to real platforms is
    also provided (allowing you to really use your application once you're
    done with developing it).
  
    GRAS thus constitute a complete grid application developement framework,
    encompassing both developer helping tools (the simulator and associated
    tools) and an efficient while portable execution runtime.
  
    \section GRAS_who Who should use this (and who shouldn't)
    
    You should use this programming environment if you want to develop real
    applications, ie if the final result of your work is a program which 
    may eventually be distributed. 
    If you just want to study some heuristics for a given problem you don't
    want to implement really (ie, if your result would be a theorem), have a
    look at the \ref MSG_API one.
    If you want to study an existing MPI program, have a look at the 
    \ref SMPI_API one. 
    If none of those programming environments fits your needs, you may
    consider implementing your own directly on top of \ref SURF_API (but you
    probably want to contact us before).

/** \defgroup AMOK_API AMOK
    \ingroup SimGrid_API
    \brief Distributed toolkit built over \ref GRAS_API (Advanced Metacomputing Overlay Kit)

    AMOK provides several tools useful to most applications built on top of GRAS, 
    but yet not belonging to GRAS itself. It is planned that those modules will be 
    changed to real plugins one day, allowing users to load only the needed parts at
    run time. For now, they live in another library against which you should link your 
    programs explicitly.

/** \defgroup SMPI_API      SMPI
    \ingroup SimGrid_API
    \brief Programming environment for the simulation of MPI applications
  
    Once implemented, this programming environment will allow you to study
    within the simulator any MPI application without having to modify them
    for that. In other words, it will constitute an emulation solution for
    parallel codes.
    
    \section SMPI_who Who should use this (and who shouldn't)
    
    You should use this programming environment of the SimGrid suite if you
    want to study existing MPI applications.
    If you want to work on a distributed application, have a look at the 
    \ref GRAS_API environment. 
    If you want to study some heuristics for a given problem (and if your
    goal is to produce theorems, not code), have a look at the \ref MSG_API
    environment.
    If none of those programming environments fits your needs, you may
    consider implementing your own directly on top of \ref SURF_API (but you
    probably want to contact us before).
