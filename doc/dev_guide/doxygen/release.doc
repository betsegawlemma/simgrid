\subsection release_c_source Building the source archive

First, clean up your git repository. Some files are included through
globbing, you must ensure that your tree contains no cruft. You can
either checkout a new tree or remove anything from your current tree:
\verbatim
$ cd simgrid
$ git stash
$ git stash clear
$ git clean -dfx
\endverbatim

You can then build the archive. This gives you your archive in the
build dir, named 'SimGrid-${release_version}.tar.gz'.

\verbatim
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make dist
\endverbatim

\subsection release_c_win32 Binary distribution under Win32

You have to install nsis tool first. Download it 
<a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download">here</a>.

Then be sure having wget.exe in your path to get the online documentation. You can download it 
<a href="http://users.ugent.be/~bpuype/wget/">here</a>.

You can finally make the win installer.
\verbatim
$ cd simgrid
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make nsis
\endverbatim

\subsection release_c_postchecks Check list after releasing

- Tag the git repository (don't forget to push the tags to the main
  repo)
- Push the archive files on gforge
- Update the link ff-scm-v4-prod:/home/groups/simgrid/htdocs/simgrid/lastest
- Announce the release
 - Mail the simgrid-user mailing list
    - the NEWS chunk in the mail;
    - the ChangeLog chunk as attachement
 - Also mail some other lists (G5K users), with only the NEWS chunk
   and the link to the download section

\section release_bindings Releasing the bindings

Please apply the above checklists before and after releasing the bindings.

Then, clean your git repository and build the archive. It will give
you an archive file in the build dir:
'SimGrid-Java-${release_version}.tar.gz' or
'SimGrid-Ruby-${release_version}.tar.gz'. 

\verbatim
$ cd simgrid-java (or simgrid-ruby)
$ git stash
$ git stash clear
$ git clean -dfx
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make dist
\endverbatim
