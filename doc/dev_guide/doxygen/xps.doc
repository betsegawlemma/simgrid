\subsection xps_dev_guide_pipol_general What is PIPOL?

The PIPOL platform is a porting, testing and compilation cluster. It hosts several hardware and software
architectures to perform its work. An user can reserve a resource (a specific hardware, an operating system...)
to be used interactively or automatically (with a "Nightly Builds" system) for software testing.
