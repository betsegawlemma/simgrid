/*! \page options Simgrid options and configurations

\htmlinclude .options.doc.toc

A number of options can be given at runtime to change the default
SimGrid behavior. For a complete list of all configuration options
accepted by the SimGrid version used in your simulator, simply pass
the --help configuration flag to your program. If some of the options
are not documented on this page, this is a bug that you should please
report so that we can fix it.

\section options_using Passing configuration options to the simulators

There is several way to pass configuration options to the simulators.
The most common way is to use the \c --cfg command line argument. For
example, to set the variable \c Variable to the value \c Value, simply
type the following: \verbatim
my_simulator --cfg=Variable:Value (other arguments)
\endverbatim

Several \c --cfg command line arguments can naturally be used. If you
need to include spaces in the argument, don't forget to quote the
argument. You can even escape the included quotes (write \' for ' if
you have your argument between ').

Another solution is to use the \c \<config\> tag in the platform file. The
only restriction is that this tag must occure before the first
platform element (be it \c \<AS\>, \c \<cluster\>, \c \<peer\> or whatever).
The \c \<config\> tag takes an \c id attribute, but it is currently
ignored so you don't really need to pass it. The important par is that
within that tag, you can pass one or several \c \<prop\> tags to specify
the configuration to use. For example, setting \c Variable to \c Value
can be done by adding the following to the beginning of your platform
file: \verbatim
<config>
  <prop id="Variable" value="Value"/>
</config>
\endverbatim

A last solution is to pass your configuration directly using the C
interface. Unfortunately, this path is not really easy to use right
now, and you mess directly with surf variables as follows. Check the
\ref XBT_config "relevant page" for details on all the functions you
can use in this context (\c _surf_cfg_set is the only configuration set
currently used in SimGrid). \code
#include <xbt/config.h>

extern xbt_cfg_t _surf_cfg_set;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
     MSG_global_init(&argc, argv);
     
     xbt_cfg_set_parse(_surf_cfg_set,"Variable:Value");
     
     // Rest of your code
}
\endcode

\section options_model Configuring the platform models

\subsection options_model_select Selecting the platform models

SimGrid comes with several network and CPU models built in, and you
can change the used model at runtime by changing the passed
configuration. The three main configuration variables are given below.
For each of these variable, passing the special \c help value gives
you a short description of all possible values. 
   - \b network/model: specify the used network model
   - \b cpu/model: specify the used CPU model
   - \b workstation/model: specify the used workstation model

As of writting, the accepted network models are the following. Over
the time new models can be added, and some experimental models can be
removed; check the values on your simulators for an uptodate
information. Note that the CM02 model is described in the research report
<a href="ftp://ftp.ens-lyon.fr/pub/LIP/Rapports/RR/RR2002/RR2002-40.ps.gz">A
Network Model for Simulation of Grid Application</a> while LV08 is
described in 
<a href="http://mescal.imag.fr/membres/arnaud.legrand/articles/simutools09.pdf">Accuracy Study and Improvement of Network Simulation in the SimGrid Framework</a>.

  - \b LV08 (default one): Realistic network analytic model
    (slow-start modeled by multiplying latency by 10.4, bandwidth by
    .92; bottleneck sharing uses a payload of S=8775 for evaluating RTT)
  - \b Constant: Simplistic network model where all communication
    take a constant time (one second). This model provides the lowest
    realism, but is (marginally) faster.
  - \b SMPI: Realistic network model specifically tailored for HPC
    settings (accurate modeling of slow start with correction factors on
    three intervals: < 1KiB, < 64 KiB, >= 64 KiB)
  - \b CM02: Legacy network analytic model (Very similar to LV08, but
    without corrective factors. The timings of small messages are thus
    poorly modeled)
  - \b Reno: Model from Steven H. Low using lagrange_solve instead of
    lmm_solve (experts only; check the code for more info).
  - \b Reno2: Model from Steven H. Low using lagrange_solve instead of
    lmm_solve (experts only; check the code for more info).
  - \b Vegas: Model from Steven H. Low using lagrange_solve instead of
    lmm_solve (experts only; check the code for more info).

If you compiled SimGrid accordingly, you can use packet-level network
simulators as network models (see \ref pls). In that case, you have
two extra models:
  - \b GTNets: Network pseudo-model using the GTNets simulator instead
    of an analytic model 
  - \b NS3: Network pseudo-model using the NS3 tcp model instead of an
    analytic model	

Concerning the CPU, we have only one model for now:
  - \b Cas01: Simplistic CPU model (time=size/power)
  
The workstation concept is the aggregation of a CPU with a network
card. Three models exists, but actually, only 2 of them are
interesting. The "compound" one is simply due to the way our internal
code is organized, and can easily be ignored. So at the end, you have
two workstation models: The default one allows to aggregate an
existing CPU model with an existing network model, but does not allow
parallel tasks because these beasts need some collaboration between
the network and CPU model. That is why, ptask_07 is used by default
when using SimDag.
  - \b default: Default workstation model. Currently, CPU:Cas01 and 
    network:LV08 (with cross traffic enabled)
  - \b compound: Workstation model that is automatically chosen if
    you change the network and CPU models
  - \b ptask_L07: Workstation model somehow similar to Cas01+CM02 but
    allowing parallel tasks
  
Finally, the network and CPU models that are based on lmm_solve (that
is, all our analytical models) accept specific optimization
configurations (through the \b network/optim and \b CPU/optim
variables). The accepted values are (both default to 'Lazy'):
  - \b Lazy: Lazy action management (partial invalidation in lmm +
    heap in action remaining).
  - \b TI: Trace integration. Highly optimized mode when using
    availability traces (only available for the Cas01 CPU model for
    now). 
  - \b Full: Full update of remaining and variables. Slow but may be
    useful when debugging.


\subsection options_model_network Configuring the Network model

\subsubsection options_model_network_gamma Maximal TCP window size (network/TCP_gamma)

The analytical models need to know the maximal TCP window size to take
the TCP congestion mechanism into account. This is set to 20000 by
default, but can be changed using the network/TCP_gamma variable.

On linux, this value can be retrieved using the following
commands. Both give a set of values, and you should use the last one,
which is the maximal size.\verbatim
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem # gives the sender window
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem # gives the receiver window
\endverbatim

\subsubsection options_model_network_crosstraffic Simulating cross-traffic (network/crosstraffic)

As of SimGrid v3.7, cross-traffic effects can be taken into account in
analytical simulations. It means that ongoing and incoming
communication flows are treated independently. In addition, the LV08
model adds 0.05 of usage on the opposite direction for each new
created flow. This can be useful to simulate some important TCP
phenomena such as ack compression.

For that to work, your platform must have two links for each
pair of interconnected hosts. An example of usable platform is
available in <tt>examples/msg/gtnets/crosstraffic-p.xml</tt>.

This is activated through the \b network/crosstraffic variable, that
can be set to 0 (disable this feature) or 1 (enable it).

\section options_modelchecking Model-Checking
\subsection options_modelchecking_howto How to use it
To enable the experimental SimGrid model-checking support the program should
be executed with the command line argument 
\verbatim
--cfg=model-check:1 
\endverbatim
Properties are expressed as assertions using the function
\verbatim
void MC_assert(int prop);
\endverbatim
