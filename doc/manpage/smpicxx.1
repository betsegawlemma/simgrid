.SH NAME
smpicxx \- SMPI C++ wrapper compiler
.SH SYNOPSIS
smpicxx â€¦
.SH DESCRIPTION
smpicxx is just a wrapper around the C++ compiler used to build simgrid, adding the right flags in order to use the simgrid library and SMPI, the MPI implementation within it. Any arguments filled to smpicxx will be passed to the underlying compiler directly, of which the \fB\-\-version\fR argument should give the name and the version. Please refer to its documentation in case of trouble.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
All environment variables taken into account by the underlying compiler will be used, but note that the compiler can not be modified.
