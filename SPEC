Here are some elements of specification of the GRAS protocol. It is not 
supposed to have several implementations, but once version 1 will be out,
all versions of GRAS are supposed to be able to communicate with previous
ones.

All messages have an header and a payload. Here is the header format,
considering it as an array of chars.

HEADER: Transport layer
msg[0...3]: the string 'GRAS'
msg[4]: protocol version (currently '0')

HEADER: Messaging layer

msg[5]: discriminent = Archi & msg type & Flags
	D & 248 << 3 : archi (datasize, alignment, endianess) of message emitter
	               (32 possibles; 5 known so far)
        D & 7 : Type of message:
          0: one-way message
          1: method call (answer expected)
	  
 	  2: successful return (usual datatype attached as payload)
	  3: error return (payload = remoterr)
	  
	  4..7: idem, with group communication (ask for forward)
	        list of receivers (and path for answer) placed before the
                payload 

msg[6..8]: message serial (for answers; omitted for one-ways)
           short in binary encoding (loop every 65536)
msg[9..]: message name (string in the binary encoding)

PAYLOAD: in the binary encoding
