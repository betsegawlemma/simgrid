The sha implementation (src/xbt/xbt_sha.c:) was borowed and adapted
from the iksemel one (http://code.google.com/p/iksemel/). Both the
original and the current version of this code is distributed under the
LGPL v2.1 license.

=========================================================================

Some examples for SMPI were borowed from an IBM test suite.

The xbt/mmalloc module was adapted from the mmalloc module of gdb.
Both the simgrid version and the original version is distributed under
the LGPL v2.1

This affects the files in directory src/xbt/mmalloc and
include/xbt/mmalloc.h

========================================================================= 

Some other examples for SMPI were borowed from an Argonne test suite. 
Their copyright is the following (FIXME):

Finally, some SMPI examples have unclear licence:
 examples/smpi/first.c
 examples/smpi/second.c

The directory examples/smpi/NAS contains a tweaked version of the
NAS Parallel Benchmark Team. The original software were retrieved from
here: http://www.nas.nasa.gov/Software/NPB

According to [1], this code is probably distributed under the NASA
Open Source Agreement (NOSA) version 1.3. Its text can be found at [2].

The changes over the original version are minor, and can be
distributed under the LGPL license (v2.1) or NOSA (v1.3 or higher)
licences, at your option.
