The sha implementation (src/xbt/xbt_sha.c:) was borowed and adapted
from the iksemel one (http://code.google.com/p/iksemel/). Both the
original and the current version of this code is distributed under the
LGPL v2.1 license.

The xbt/mmalloc module was adapted from the mmalloc module of gdb.
Both the simgrid version and the original version is distributed under
the LGPL v2.1

This affects the files in directory src/xbt/mmalloc and
include/xbt/mmalloc.h
