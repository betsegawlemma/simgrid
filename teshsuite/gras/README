This directory contains several tests to the GRAS mecanism. The
difference with the examples/gras directory is that what's in here
tests some corner case that nobody would try in the first place. Here
is a list of the directory content:

empty_main/ Once upon a time, GRAS was broken when processes did
	    nothing. This test is here to ensure that this never
	    happen again.
	    
msg_handle/ Ensures the wanted semantic for gras_msg_handle(i) when
            i<0, i==0 and i>0.

numerous_rpc/ Ensures that it is ok to have a very large amount of
              very small RPC in real life (it used to be a race
              condition in the socket mechanism stuff)
