This directory contains several tests to the GRAS mecanism. The
difference with the examples/gras directory is that what's in here
tests some corner case that nobody would try in the first place. Here
is a list of the directory content:

datadesc/ Tests the marshalling facilities, trying to read messages
	  comming from all the known architectures. This is done by
	  storing these messages in files and loading them as if they
	  were comming from a socket.
	  	  
empty_main/ Once upon a time, GRAS was broken when processes did
	    nothing. This test is here to ensure that this never
	    happen again.
	    
msg_handle/ Ensures the wanted semantic for gras_msg_handle(i) when
            i<0, i==0 and i>0.
