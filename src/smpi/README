Quick Notes : getting started with the examples
===============================================

Go to :
# cd simgrid/src/smpi/sample

To compile an example : 
# ../smpicc bcast.c -o bcast

Use 'smpirun' to use it then:

To run it : 
# ../smpirun -np 3 ./bcast 
node 0 has value 17
node 2 has value 3
node 1 has value 3
node 1 has value 17
node 0 has value 17
node 2 has value 17
[0.000000] [smpi_kernel/INFO] simulation time 4.32934e-05


To run it with a specific platform:
# ../smpirun -np 3 -platform platform.xml -hostfile hostfile ./bcast
