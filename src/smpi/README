Quick Notes : getting started with the examples
===============================================

..:: What you need ::..

- a platform file describing the environment. You can go to 
  the Platform Description Archive (http://pda.gforge.inria.fr/) to
  get an existing one or generate your own platform with the
  SIMULACRUM tool (see 'Download' section there).

- a hostfile. Like in almost all MPI distributions, the hostfile
  list the hosts which the processes will be mapped on. At present,
  the format is one hostname per line. The hostnames must be present
  in the platform file. 

  Note: the mapping of MPI processes (ranks) follows the order of the
        hostfile. Rank 0 is mapped to first hostname in hostfile, Rank 1
        on second hostname, etc. If n (where -np n) is greater than the
        number l of lines in hostfile, the mapping is done round-robin. 


..:: Try the examples ::..

Go to :
# cd simgrid/examples/smpi

To compile an example : 
# ../../src/smpi/smpicc bcast.c -o bcast

Use 'smpirun' to use it then:

To run it : 
# ../../src/smpi/smpirun -np 3 ./bcast 
node 0 has value 17
node 2 has value 3
node 1 has value 3
node 1 has value 17
node 0 has value 17
node 2 has value 17
[0.000000] [smpi_kernel/INFO] simulation time 4.32934e-05


To run it with a specific platform:
# ../../src/smpi/smpirun -np 3 -platform platform.xml -hostfile hostfile ./bcast

Note that by default, the examples use the installed version of
simgrid. So please install it before playing with the examples, or set
a LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable pointing to src/.libs
