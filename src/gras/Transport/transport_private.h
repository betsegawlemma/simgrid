   the same socket again afterward without select()ing at all.

   it gets closed by the user. If not, we use an already freed pointer, which is bad.

  I'm tired of that shit. the select in SG has to create a socket to expeditor
  manually do deal with the weirdness of the hostdata, themselves here to deal
  with the weird channel concept of SG and convert them back to ports.
  
  When introducing buffered transport (which I want to get used in SG to debug
  the buffering itself), we should not make the rest of the code aware of the
  change and not specify code for this. This is bad design.
  
  But there is bad design all over the place, so fuck off for now, when we can
  get rid of MSG and rely directly on SG, this crude hack can go away. But in
  the meanwhile, I want to sleep this night (FIXME).
  
  Hu! You evil problem! Taste my axe!
