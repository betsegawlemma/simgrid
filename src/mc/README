This file lists the issues to solve to achieve a the full integration of the MC branch:
- Model-checker entry point: 
  Up to now, the main function of each user API has to be modified to call MC_modelcheck instead of SIMIX_solve. 
  It would be nice to have a command line option like --model-check to determine the right behaviour.

- Memory managment routines:
  Because mc_memory.c redefines malloc, calloc, realloc and free, now even the simulator is going to use
  the mmalloc library. This is no good because it is far slower than GNU's malloc, so some black magic should be
  used to link against one library or the other depending on the mode choosed by the user.
